## Uliza Test

This application is an example of a question/answer API

One client-facing platform (https://abrupt-visage.glitch.me/) displays all of the questions currently asked and allows one to view the answers (if they exist)

The other client-facing platform (https://abrupt-visage.glitch.me/experts) displays all of the unanswered questions currently available and allows one to answer the questions

This application uses a SQLite database to store questions and answers in their respective tables.
